[![buddy pipeline](https://app.buddy.works/afgor/neuralnetworks/pipelines/pipeline/43558/badge.svg?token=38a71b28199405f84b29bbcf4cee2f85f9c914330b0a69437c1fe497bcd05c3c "buddy pipeline")](https://app.buddy.works/afgor/neuralnetworks/pipelines/pipeline/43558)

**Obcidian Network** is a C# library that would help you create your own neural networks.

It has some major fetures:

  - Multiple input neurons
  - Multiple and deep computational neurons, each can have own function
  - Simple neuron connections

You can also:
  - Dynamicaly create neurons
  - Remap connections
  - Override computational neurons structure


> The main feature of this library is to give user maximum control over the Neural network.

### Hot to start

1. Download library with binaries from github releases page.
2. Create a new project, or implement the library in existing project.
3. Use library as you need. (more info on WIKI pages)
