# **Obcidian Network** - a simple neural network library
[![Issue Count](https://codeclimate.com/github/MarkusBansky/Obcidian-Network/badges/issue_count.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/MarkusBansky/Obcidian-Network)

**Obcidian Network** is a C# library that would help you create your own neural networks.

You can install **Obcidian Network** from **NuGet** package manager.
 > PM> `Install-Package ObcidiaNetwork`

**Nuget Package** does not include the latest version of neural network. It uses only builds from *master* branch. If you want the latest release of neural network, please search it on github in prerelase.

If you are an enthusiast or a student and want to learn how the neural networks work then this is a good solution for you. Everything is very simple and easy to instal. You can instal *ObcidiaNetwork* from *NuGet* and use it in any C# project you can.

It has some major features:
  - Multiple input, computational, biases, output neurons
  - Simple neural connections
  - Optimized algorithm
  - Low memory usage
  - High performance
  - File import / export
  - Automated training
