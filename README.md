**Obcidian Network** is a C# library that would help you create your own neural networks.

You can install **Obcidian Network** from **NuGet** package manager.
 > PM> `Install-Package ObcidiaNetwork`

If you are an enthusiast or a student and want to learn how the neural networks work then this is a good solution for you.

Everything is very simple and easy to instal. You can instal *ObcidiaNetwork* from *NuGet* and use it in any C# project you can.

It has some major fetures:

  - Multiple input, computational, biases, output neurons
  - Simple neural connections
  - Optimized algorithm
  - Low memory usage
  - High performance, as network is stored in RAM
  - Visual debugger
  - JSON scheme export

For future I plan:
  - Remap connections
  - Dynamicaly create connections that affect outputs for best result
  - Dynamicalt create neurons for better results
  - Automated trainings
  - Better performance
